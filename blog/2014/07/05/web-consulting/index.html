<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/ppl-skyline.jpg" title="How to start web consulting" class="banner-img"  /></p>

<p>I have lots of advice for you. I just moved from a corporate job to rails consulting 2-4mo ago, because someone offered me more money than I could say no to.</p>

<h1>Types of consultants</h1>

<p>This is my paradigm of freelance web/mobile consulting. There are 4 types of developers that do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The developer that is 30+ years old and has worked in a consulting corporate job for many years. He has a strong relationship with a handful of clients, and he leaves his job, takes the clients and now he has 2-3 companies that love him and will always give him work every year. They only do work that they want to do and at the rate they want (Usually $120+/hr).</p></li>
<li><p>There are the developers that hopefully know coding really well, but they don&rsquo;t have a strong network of clients. They are probably looking online at oDesk/Freelancer, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, or maybe posting on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7970372">HN</a>. They probably have a website and maybe their SEO rank is super awesome for a &ldquo;{technology} {city}&rdquo; search in Google.</p>

<p> This type may even pay for services like LeadSugar. I have never subscribed to websites like that, but I feel like the most profitable awesome contracts are not going to be found posted publicly online.</p></li>
<li><p>This would be a graduate of type two, where they have 2-3 companies that love them, that will always put food on the table, and hopefully pay them what they want to get paid. I feel like there is a bit of luck to get here, but not impossible. I do not know a single developer in this type.</p></li>
<li><p>The last type is a type 2 developer, that a type 1 person is giving extra work to that they don&rsquo;t want to do or can&rsquo;t do. They share a piece of the pie with you, because they want to grow their consultancies into a developer shop, or maybe they just want to work on other things, but they still want to capitalize on their network.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am a type 2 developer, that knows several type 1 developers, and thus ended up in type 4. I have found that most of the jobs posted publicly, where type 2s look for work, are low paying and terrible. The clients posting them look at development as a commodity and aim for the lowest bidder. There are tons (corporate full timers looking to augment income, college kids, 3rd world, etc.) of type 2 developers looking to fill these gigs. Most of these gigs pay low. They want to spend $500 to build Facebook.com for puppies and they will have at least 8 people bidding on their project.</p>

<h1>Actionable Advice</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have a terrible portfolio, look at doing a few bad jobs off of <a href="https://www.odesk.com">oDesk</a> to build that out. Write super awesome code and get good at what you do. You need to set yourself apart, skill wise, from all of the other developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Riches are in the niches. I met a developer last week that started programming at age 28, 4 years ago, and he has gotten really good at <a href="http://www.webrtc.org">WebRTC</a>. He is one of a very few &lsquo;experts&rsquo; on the stack in South East USA and anyone that wants WebRTC consulting has to talk with him. I am sure he is terrible at programming, but if he is the only webrtc pro, then that is all that matters. Find a niche.</p></li>
<li><p>Attend tech (ruby on rails, android, etc) meetups. I have a pretty strong network of developers and one of them took me under his wing and has been handing me his client work. He is taking money off the top, but I am still making my rate (which is at least 2x what I would expect from oDesk jobs), so I am happy. You will not find direct clients at tech meet ups, but you might can find mentors or other consultants that have too much on their plate.</p></li>
<li><p>Attend non-tech events in industries known to need and use technology (marketing, sales, small business, etc.). You want industries that make a lot of money, and already pay for technology. Hopefully you will find projects here like: &ldquo;I need my sales force account hooked into my <a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com">Infusionsoft</a> account with <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> integration so that I can be notified about new clients.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I have talked <a href="/blog/2014/06/21/goodie-hack-number-2/">before about my experiences</a> at <a href="http://goodiehack.com">Goodie Hack</a>.  There were very few developers there and lots of people looking for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse sale recruiters. I get hit up by recruiters weekly asking if I want to work at the &ldquo;hottest start up in ___.&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Hey, I am not looking for a position right now, but I am looking to take on new contracts. I will give you $500 gift card, if you refer a client to me and we seal a +1 month contract.&rdquo; Now I got a little team of people interested in helping me out.</p></li>
<li><p>Attend <a href="http://www.atlsuds.com/">startup</a> events. There are lots of people that have ideas, raised millions of dollars, but don&rsquo;t have the tech talent to build what they want to build. You need to find these people. Build relationships with VC firms. There are lots of startups with a $200,000 tech budget and no one to spend it on.</p></li>
